                    <p><strong>The beginning… </strong><br/>
Sindhu and Amrit met in the Fall of 2010 at the beginning of their Sophomore year of college. Both attended the University of Illinois and were heavily involved in the two largest South Asian dance teams on campus, which allowed them to get to know each other much better. They say that the best of love stories blossom out of the best of friendships, and that’s exactly what happened between Sindhu and Amrit. Over the course of their sophomore year, the two developed a strong friendship. It was during the summer between their sophomore and junior years of college that they realized what was between them was more than a friendship. After dancing around each other, quite literally, for almost three months they decided to make things official in the winter months of 2010. </p>

                    <p><strong>The proposal...</strong><br/>
In the fall of 2015, Amrit decided it was time. After carefully picking out the perfect ring and planning for weeks, on September 15th, 2015, Amrit got down on one knee and asked Sindhu to marry him. With the help of both his own and Sindhu’s families, he was able to create the most perfect proposal. The special event happened at the gazebo near Sindhu’s home where the couple spent many hours getting to know each other at the beginning of their relationship. Along with Gautham, his sister and cousin, Amrit decorated the gazebo with beautiful drapes, balloons, blankets and candles. When everything was ready, he called Sindhu in a frenzy with news of a flat tire. Sindhu came rushing over to help, only to find that there was no flat tire after all. She then walked into the gazebo to the most amazing surprise, and with that, the couple was engaged. </p>

                        <small>Father of the Groom</small>
                    </h3>
                    <p> Ganesh Bhaskarla is definitely a cool dad. Ganesh has known the groom for, well, his entire life. On an average day, you might find him in his study reading a book, karaoke-ing along to a classic hindi tune, or perhaps laughing along to a hilarious episode of Seinfield. Whether it's tennis, dance or medical school, he has proven to be an unwavering source of support for Amrit. Like the rest of us, he is excited for the upcoming festivities and can't wait to unleash some of his renowned dance moves on the floor. </p>

                    </h3>
                     <p> Vyshnava Bhaskarla is the groom's head cheerleader. As an expert chef, Vyshnava is the only person in the world who can make Amrit's favorite food, chicken curry, just right (good luck Sindhu). She is always willing and ready to hold out a helping hand to her son. On your average day, you might find her practicing her singing talents after a session at the yoga studio or a nice walk at the forest perseve. She's looking forward to the wedding and reception, but we're all just hoping that she doesn't get carded at the bar. </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p> Known to be the younger (but obviously cuter) version of Amrit, Anusha Bhaskarla wins the title for "most devoted sister". The two Bhaskarla children bond over their similar, unique sense of humor, and together they can be the life of any party. Anusha is looking forward to jet setting all over the world this coming March for the two lovely ceremonies, traveling from her semester long home in Barcelona to both India and Chicago. If you find her asleep in the corner of the reception hall, well, now you know why. </p>

                    </h3>
                     <p>Ila Bala is the Bride's best friend. Sindhu can go to her with anything, whether it's a silly story, or just for some advise. Ila is in love with her flowers and her garden is where she can be found on most summer days. Ila has been a part of the Bride's life every step of the way and is a huge influence to Sindhu pursuing a career within healthcare. Ila's amazing idli and dosa are probably what Sindhu will miss most about home. If you find her at the reception, don't forget to pull her onto the dance floor.</p>

                        <p>The Naperville yogi, Bala, is passionate about organinc gardening, appreciating fine wines, and watching sports. With his great leadership qualities and healthy, practical lifestyle, he has been a great role model to the Bride for her entire life. Bala is eagerly awaiting the wedding ceremony which is to take place in his hometown of Madurai, India. For anyone with an interest in yoga, catch him at the reception for a quick tutorial, which he'd be happy to give. </p>

                     <p>Gautham Bala is the Bride’s (second) best friend and man of honor. A great listener when Sindhu has to vent, he has a big heart and Sindhu couldn't ask for a better younger brother. Gautham loves coaching tennis and helping people, two of many qualities that make him the most eligible bachelor on the market. Fully convinced that his mom and Amrit love him more than his sister, Gautham never fails to annoy the Bride on a daily basis. Find him next to the DJ booth at the recpetion trying to convince the DJ to play the hottest tamil songs on the charts.</p>
